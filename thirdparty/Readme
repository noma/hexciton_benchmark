The following thirdparty solutions are used.
Check out the links below for further information.

To automatically download and build everything simply run "download.sh"
followed by "build.sh". See the scripts for details.

If you only want to download and build the thirdparty codes needed for either
the OpenCL or OpenMP version of the benchmark, run the scripts with the
according suffix.

The archive "downloads_omp.tar.gz" contains versions of the thirdparty codes
needed for the OpenMP version. If you don't wish to download, simply run:
	tar -xzf downloads_omp.tar.gz
	./build_omp.sh
